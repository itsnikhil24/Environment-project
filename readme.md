# ü•ÅIntroduction

Our platform is designed to promote environmental sustainability within industrial sectors by incentivizing factory owners to adopt eco-friendly practices. By creating a profile on our platform, factory owners can actively contribute to reducing pollution, conserving resources, and increasing sustainability. The platform rewards these efforts with points that can be used to claim government tax benefits, boosts visibility through a leaderboard, and connects owners with NGOs offering employee training sessions on maximizing eco-friendly practices.

## üí°Inspiration:


The inspiration for this project arose from the growing environmental concerns surrounding the industrial sector. Factories are one of the largest contributors to pollution, greenhouse gas emissions, and resource depletion. However, many factory owners are unaware of the potential benefits of adopting sustainable practices or lack the tools to implement them effectively. Our solution focuses on making sustainability rewarding for factory owners by providing concrete incentives, tax benefits, and visibility through a community-driven approach. The goal is to encourage more factories to adopt green technologies, reduce their environmental impact, and foster a culture of sustainability across industries.
  
## üí¨ What it does:

- **Factory Profiles:** Factory owners can create their profiles, detailing their sustainable practices, such as reducing emissions, improving energy efficiency, or using sustainable materials.
- **Reward Points System:** For each eco-friendly action taken, factory owners earn points. These points can be exchanged for government tax breaks, financial incentives, or other rewards. For example, using renewable energy sources or reducing water usage can yield points.
- **Leaderboard & Visibility:** The platform features a leaderboard that ranks the highest-performing factories based on their sustainability efforts. Top factories receive increased visibility and marketing opportunities, helping them attract customers who value environmental responsibility.
- **NGO Portal:** A dedicated section for NGOs offering eco-friendly training and resources for factory employees. This helps factory owners access professional development and knowledge on best practices for reducing their environmental impact.
- **Advertisement Benefits:** Factories that rank high on the leaderboard can claim advertisement benefits, promoting their green practices to a wider audience and further boosting their profile.


## üõ† How we built it

We built the application using EJS for rendering dynamic HTML, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for client-side functionality. The server-side operations were handled by Node.js and Express, while MongoDB was used for database management.


## ‚ùóChallenges we ran into:

- **Data Integration:** Ensuring accurate tracking of factory efforts and smooth integration of the points system with the backend.
- **Leaderboard Scalability:** Managing large datasets and ensuring real-time leaderboard updates without compromising performance.
